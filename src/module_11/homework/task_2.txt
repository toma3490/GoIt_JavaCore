Five Little Jack-o'-Lanterns
Five little jack-o'-lanterns sitting on a gate.
The first one said, "My, it's getting late."
The second one said, "There are witches in the air."
The third one said, "But we don't care."
The fourth one said, "Let's run, let's run."
The fifth one said, "It's really Halloween fun."
Puff went the wind, out went the light.
And off ran the jack-o'-lanterns on Halloween night.
