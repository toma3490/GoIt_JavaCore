I say good morning to the sun,
Good morning to the hills,
Good morning to the chickies and the hen.
"cluck, cluck".
Good morning to the rooster,
Good morning to the cow,
Good morning piggies in the pen.
"oink, oink".
I say, "Good morning, good morning,"
To everything in sight.
And when I am finished
It's time to say "Good night".
